## Introduction

Llama-fine-tuning is a project focused on fine-tuning the Meta-Llama model for various text generation applications. The Meta-Llama model is a powerful language model that can generate human-like text based on the input it receives. This project aims to make it easier for developers and researchers to fine-tune the model on their own datasets and use it for custom text generation tasks.

## Installation

To get started with Llama-fine-tuning, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YogeshKumarPatel873/Llama-fine-tuning.git
cd Llama-fine-tuning
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Dataset Preparation

Before fine-tuning the Meta-Llama model, you'll need to prepare your dataset. Ensure that your dataset is in a suitable format (e.g., plain text, JSON) and clean any unwanted noise or errors.

### Training

To fine-tune the Meta-Llama model, run the training script with your dataset:

```bash
python train.py --dataset_path path/to/your/dataset --output_dir path/to/save/model
```

You can adjust various hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs through command-line arguments or by modifying the configuration file.

### Generating Text

After fine-tuning, you can use the trained model to generate text. Run the generation script as follows:

```bash
python generate.py --model_path path/to/saved/model --prompt "Your input prompt here"
```

The script will output the generated text based on the provided prompt.
